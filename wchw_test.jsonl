{"question": "What is multicarrier modulation? How is it related to OFDM?", "answer": "Multicarrier modulation splits a high‑rate serial bit stream of rate R_b into N parallel substreams of rate R_b/N, and independently modulates each on a different subcarrier; the subcarriers are then summed for transmission and separately demodulated/recombined at the receiver. OFDM is a particular multicarrier scheme in which all subcarriers are strictly orthogonal, with spacing Δf = 1/T where T is the symbol duration on each subcarrier; it is typically implemented via IFFT/FFT.", "cot": "1) Define the idea: A single high‑rate stream is converted to N lower‑rate parallel streams so each subchannel uses a smaller symbol rate, easing ISI and filtering. Formally, the serial stream of rate \\(R_b\\) is split to \\(N\\) paths, each at \\(R_b/N\\). 2) Each path modulates its own subcarrier and the resulting passband signals are summed; at the receiver, each subcarrier is demodulated and the N streams are recombined. 3) State the OFDM link: OFDM is a special multicarrier form imposing orthogonality among subcarriers so that intercarrier interference is avoided. The k‑th subcarrier uses frequency \\(f_k = f_0 + k\\Delta f\\) with \\(\\Delta f = 1/T\\), guaranteeing \\(\\int_0^T e^{j2\\pi (f_k-f_m)t}\\,dt = 0\\) for \\(k\\ne m\\).
